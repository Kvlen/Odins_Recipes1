    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed</li>

        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil, can sub canola oil</li>

        <li>seasonings(salt and pepper) add other if you want</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>

        <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>

        <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>

        <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Do not overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they wonâ€™t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>

        <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
    </ol>
